In order to realize this potential India will have to overcome various challenges, key amongst them being the challenge of health and nutrition for its people, since inadequate nutrition has an adverse impact and lowers productivity and output of people. This is already a challenge across the income pyramid. Almost 55% women in urban India suffer from micronutrient deficiencies. More than 75% of pre-school children suffer from micronutrient deficiencies, and over 50% mortality amongst children is attributed to malnutrition. While much of this is possibly linked to poverty and /or lack of awareness even across families that are economically better off, economic growth is also accompanied with the lifestyle diseases including diabetes, hypertension and cardio-vascular. These lifestyle diseases result from inadequate understanding of nutrition, the inability to follow a balanced lifestyle and sometimes due to lack of options. Clearly nutrition and food will play an important role in shaping the quality of life in India but there is no easy solution. India\\u2019s social structure and demography is complex and food habits are very diverse and often based on climatic and regional differences, and food choices are also influenced by income disparities. Moreover, whether people consume food for convenience, nutrition, indulgence or for responsible pleasure is a personal choice.
